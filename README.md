# GoalTender

GoalTender is a simple Android and iOS app designed to do one thing: help you change habits by creating and tracking simple daily goals.  See [this article](https://hbr.org/2017/02/break-bad-habits-with-a-simple-checklist) for the inspiration behind this project.

GoalTender is also the first app I've written using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).  Not sure I'd recommend it as an example, but where I ended with overall code structure both made sense and helped me move faster.

## Using GoalTender

You can install GoalTender from the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-goaltender/id1398117026) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stevezero.goaltender).


## What's Next?

GoalTender is specifically designed to be as simple as possible--see the original design reference [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1pkqTmK-7ux-nll-wbVUA1Neuq8JssHBepDokhZeKd60/edit?usp=sharing).

There are a couple features I'm thinking about next, starting with adding the ability to auth and store data off-device.
